# TODO - Redmine MCP Server Improvements

## Completed ✅
- [x] Server implementation consolidation (eliminated duplicate STDIO server)
- [x] FastMCP as single server implementation with native STDIO support
- [x] Bug verification for issue creation (empty response bug fixed)
- [x] Branch-specific container labeling for version comparison
- [x] **Configuration Management** - Centralized environment variable handling and validation
- [x] **Error Standardization** - Consistent error response format across all modules
- [x] **Service Layer Pattern** - Extracted business logic from API clients
- [x] **Tool Registry System** - Decoupled tool definitions from server class
- [x] **Modular Architecture** - Complete restructure with core/services/tools separation
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing** - Validated modular architecture with test suite
- [x] **Production-Ready Server** - Functional MCP server with real Redmine integration

### Completed Architecture Patterns

#### ✅ Tool Registry Pattern
- Decoupled tool definitions from server class
- Plugin-like architecture for extending functionality
- Individual tools testable in isolation

#### ✅ Service Layer Pattern  
- Extracted business logic from API clients
- Added validation, caching, and cross-cutting concerns
- Better testability with service mocks

#### ✅ Configuration Management
- Centralized environment variable handling
- Type-safe configuration with validation
- Environment-specific overrides

#### ✅ Error Handling System
- Consistent error handling across all modules
- Standardized error response formats  
- Better error context and traceability
