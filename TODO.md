# TODO - Redmine MCP Server Improvements

## Completed ✅
- [x] Server implementation consolidation (eliminated duplicate STDIO server)
- [x] FastMCP as single server implementation with native STDIO support
- [x] Bug verification for issue creation (empty response bug fixed)
- [x] Branch-specific container labeling for version comparison

## High Priority 🔥

### Architecture & Code Quality
- [ ] **Configuration Management** - Centralize environment variable handling and validation
- [ ] **Error Standardization** - Consistent error response format across all modules
- [ ] **Service Layer Pattern** - Extract business logic from API clients
- [ ] **Tool Registry System** - Decouple tool definitions from server class

### Testing & Reliability  
- [ ] **Comprehensive Test Suite** - Unit tests for all service layers
- [ ] **Integration Testing** - End-to-end MCP protocol testing
- [ ] **Performance Testing** - Connection pool and retry logic validation

## Medium Priority 📋

### Developer Experience
- [ ] **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible framework for custom functionality
- [ ] **Enhanced Logging** - Structured logging with context
- [ ] **Documentation** - API documentation and usage examples

### Operations
- [ ] **Health Monitoring** - Enhanced observability and metrics
- [ ] **Caching Layer** - Performance optimizations for frequent requests
- [ ] **Connection Pooling** - Optimize Redmine API connections

## Low Priority 📝

### Features
- [ ] **Custom Field Support** - Handle Redmine custom fields properly
- [ ] **Attachment Management** - File upload/download capabilities
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering** - Complex query support for issues/projects
- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Multi-issue/project operations

### Infrastructure
- [ ] **Multi-transport Support** - SSE and HTTP streaming options
- [ ] **Authentication Extensions** - LDAP/OAuth integration support
- [ ] **Rate Limiting** - Respect Redmine API limits

## Current Issues to Address

### Code Quality Issues
- [ ] Mixed abstraction levels in `redmine_client.py`
- [ ] Inconsistent error handling across modules
- [ ] Environment variables scattered throughout codebase
- [ ] Monolithic tool registration in server class

- [ ] Feature clients exposed directly alongside delegated methods in unified client
- [ ] No separation between tool definition and implementation
- [ ] Hard to test individual tools in isolation

### Architecture Patterns to Consider

#### Tool Registry Pattern
- Decouple tool definitions from server class
- Enable plugin-like architecture for extending functionality
- Make individual tools testable in isolation

#### Service Layer Pattern  
- Extract business logic from API clients
- Add validation, caching, and cross-cutting concerns
- Better testability with service mocks

#### Configuration Management
- Centralize environment variable handling
- Type-safe configuration with validation
- Environment-specific overrides

#### Error Handling System
- Consistent error handling across all modules
- Standardized error response formats  
- Better error context and traceability
