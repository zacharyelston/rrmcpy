# Redmine MCP Server - Completion Summary

## Issue Resolution: JSON Response Handling Fixed

### Problem Identified
- MCP tool responses were being converted to strings using `str(result)` instead of preserving JSON structure
- This caused create operations to return empty responses to MCP clients
- Tool name mismatches between registry and FastMCP registration

### Solution Implemented
1. **Fixed JSON Response Formatting**
   - Updated all MCP tool registrations to use `json.dumps(result, indent=2)`
   - Ensures structured data is preserved in MCP responses

2. **Corrected Tool Name Mappings**
   - Fixed tool registry references from "redmine-*" to actual class names
   - "redmine-create-issue" → "CreateIssueTool"
   - "redmine-get-issue" → "GetIssueTool"
   - "redmine-list-issues" → "ListIssuesTool" 
   - "redmine-update-issue" → "UpdateIssueTool"
   - "redmine-delete-issue" → "DeleteIssueTool"
   - "redmine-health-check" → "HealthCheckTool"
   - "redmine-get-current-user" → "GetCurrentUserTool"

3. **Consolidated to Single MCP Server**
   - Removed stdio_server.py as requested
   - Single mcp_server.py handles all MCP communication via FastMCP
   - Fixed asyncio loop issues

### Test Results
✅ **Create Issue**: Successfully creates issues and returns complete JSON data
```json
{
  "issue": {
    "id": 102,
    "subject": "Test Single MCP Server JSON Fix",
    "description": "Testing consolidated single server with JSON responses",
    "project": {"id": 1, "name": "p1"},
    "status": {"id": 1, "name": "New"},
    "created_on": "2025-06-03T15:56:41Z"
  }
}
```

✅ **Health Check**: Returns proper status information
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "healthy": true
}
```

✅ **List Issues**: Returns structured issue lists with filtering support

### Architecture Maintained
- Modular design with separate client classes (IssueClient, ProjectClient, UserClient)
- Service layer abstraction (IssueService, etc.)
- Tool registry pattern for organized tool management
- FastMCP framework integration for MCP protocol handling

### Key Features Working
- All CRUD operations for issues (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Project management operations
- User authentication and current user retrieval
- Health monitoring and connection validation
- Comprehensive error handling with proper JSON responses
- Docker containerization support
- Environment-based configuration

The Redmine MCP Server is now fully functional with proper JSON response handling and consolidated into a single, robust implementation.
