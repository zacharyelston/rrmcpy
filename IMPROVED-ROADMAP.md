## Implementation Principles

Throughout all versions, we will adhere to our design philosophy of fighting complexity:

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**
   - Eliminate complexity by making code simpler and more obvious
   - Encapsulate complexity through modular design
   - Reduce layers of indirection and unnecessary abstractions

2. **SOLID Principles**
   - Single Responsibility Principle: Each component has one reason to change
   - Open/Closed Principle: Open for extension, closed for modification
   - Liskov Substitution Principle: Proper inheritance relationships
   - Interface Segregation: No dependencies on unused interfaces
   - Dependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not implementations

3. **Complementary Principles**
   - DRY: Avoid code duplication
   - KISS: Keep solutions simple
   - YAGNI: Don't add features until needed
   - Composition Over Inheritance: Prefer composition to inheritance hierarchies

4. **FastMCP Integration**
   - Leverage native FastMCP patterns
   - Use FastMCP's built-in capabilities
   - Follow consistent FastMCP design patterns

## Code Examples for Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Fix for Create Operations Bug

```python
# Current problematic code in base.py
def make_request(self, method, endpoint, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...
    if response.content:
        result = response.json()
        return result
    return {}  # This returns empty dict for successful creates

# Fixed implementation
def make_request(self, method, endpoint, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...
    if response.status_code == 201:  # Created
        if response.content:
            return response.json()
        # For APIs that return empty 201 responses
        return {"success": True, "id": self._extract_id_from_location(response)}
    elif response.content:
        return response.json()
    return {"success": True}
    
def _extract_id_from_location(self, response):
    """Extract ID from Location header for POST requests"""
    location = response.headers.get('Location')
    if location:
        # Extract ID from location like '/issues/123.json'
        parts = location.rstrip('.json').split('/')
        return int(parts[-1]) if parts[-1].isdigit() else None
    return None
```

### 2. Implementation of Missing Project Tools

```python
@mcp.tool("redmine-create-project")
async def create_project(
    name: str,
    identifier: str,
    description: str = None,
    is_public: bool = True,
    parent_id: int = None,
    inherit_members: bool = False
):
    """Create a new project in Redmine"""
    try:
        project_data = {
            "name": name,
            "identifier": identifier,
            "is_public": is_public
        }
        if description:
            project_data["description"] = description
        if parent_id:
            project_data["parent_id"] = parent_id
        if inherit_members:
            project_data["inherit_members"] = inherit_members
            
        result = await project_client.create_project(project_data)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error creating project: {e}")
        return {"error": str(e), "success": False}
```

## Continuous Measurement

We will track the following metrics throughout development:

1. **Code Quality Metrics**
   - Cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function
   - Maximum nesting depth < 3 levels
   - Function length < 50 lines

2. **Architecture Metrics**
   - Maximum of 3 layers between API and implementation
   - No redundant implementations
   - 100% of tools use FastMCP native patterns

3. **Testing Metrics**
   - Unit test coverage > 80%
   - Integration test coverage > 60%
   - Zero failing tests in CI

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to transforming rrmcpy into a robust, well-designed Redmine MCP server. By starting with critical bug fixes and then simplifying the architecture, we ensure both immediate functionality and long-term maintainability. Throughout the process, we'll adhere to our design philosophy of fighting complexity to create a system that's easy to understand, maintain, and extend.
