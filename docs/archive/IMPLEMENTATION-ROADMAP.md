   - Implement health probes
   - Create observability dashboards

3. **Extended Resource Types**
   - Add support for more Redmine entities
   - Implement custom field support
   - Add workflow integration

4. **Integration Enhancements**
   - Add webhooks support
   - Implement event streaming
   - Create notification systems

## Implementation Principles

Throughout all versions, we will adhere to the following principles from our design philosophy:

1. **Fight Complexity**
   - Regularly review and refactor for simplicity
   - Eliminate unnecessary abstractions
   - Keep functions and classes focused and small

2. **Apply SOLID Principles**
   - Ensure Single Responsibility for all components
   - Design for extension without modification
   - Depend on abstractions, not implementations

3. **Follow Complementary Principles**
   - Apply DRY to reduce duplication
   - Use KISS to keep implementations simple
   - Follow YAGNI to avoid unnecessary features

4. **Leverage FastMCP Patterns**
   - Use native FastMCP features instead of custom implementations
   - Follow recommended FastMCP patterns
   - Stay updated with FastMCP best practices

## Continuous Measurement

We will track the following metrics throughout development:

1. **Code Quality Metrics**
   - Cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function
   - Maximum nesting depth < 3 levels
   - Function length < 50 lines

2. **Architecture Metrics**
   - Maximum of 3 layers between API and implementation
   - No redundant implementations
   - 100% of tools use FastMCP native patterns

3. **Testing Metrics**
   - Unit test coverage > 80%
   - Integration test coverage > 60%
   - Zero failing tests in CI

## Milestone Review Points

Regular review points will be scheduled to assess progress and adjust plans:

1. **End of v1.0.0**: Evaluate architectural decisions and adjust if needed
2. **End of v1.1.0**: Review service design patterns and consistency
3. **End of v1.2.0**: Evaluate tool and resource API design
4. **End of v1.3.0**: Comprehensive quality review before release

This roadmap provides a structured approach to refactoring rrmcpy while staying true to our design philosophy of fighting complexity and building maintainable software.
