## Dependencies and Sequence

The implementation sequence follows these dependencies:

1. First fix critical bugs (Phase 1) to ensure base functionality works
2. Then simplify architecture (Phase 2) to establish clean foundation
3. Next implement tools and resources (Phase 3) on the simplified architecture
4. Finally add testing and documentation (Phase 4)

Within each phase, tasks are ordered by priority but can be worked on in parallel when appropriate.

## Success Metrics

We will track progress using these metrics:

1. **Functionality Metrics**
   - [ ] Create operations return proper data
   - [ ] Complete set of tools for all core Redmine entities
   - [ ] Error responses follow consistent format

2. **Code Quality Metrics**
   - [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function
   - [ ] Maximum nesting depth < 3 levels
   - [ ] Function length < 50 lines

3. **Architecture Metrics**
   - [ ] Maximum of 3 layers between API and implementation
   - [ ] No redundant implementations
   - [ ] 100% of tools use FastMCP native patterns

4. **Testing Metrics**
   - [ ] Unit test coverage > 80%
   - [ ] Integration test coverage > 60%
   - [ ] Zero failing tests in CI

## Design Philosophy Alignment

Throughout implementation, we will continuously evaluate our work against our design philosophy of fighting complexity:

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**
   - Are we making code simpler and more obvious?
   - Are we encapsulating complexity through proper modular design?
   - Have we reduced layers of indirection and unnecessary abstractions?

2. **SOLID Principles**
   - Does each component have a single responsibility?
   - Are components open for extension but closed for modification?
   - Are we properly implementing inheritance relationships?
   - Are we avoiding dependencies on unused interfaces?
   - Do high-level modules depend on abstractions, not implementations?

3. **Complementary Principles**
   - Have we eliminated code duplication (DRY)?
   - Are we keeping solutions simple (KISS)?
   - Are we avoiding unnecessary features (YAGNI)?
   - Are we preferring composition over inheritance hierarchies?

4. **FastMCP Integration**
   - Are we leveraging native FastMCP patterns?
   - Are we using FastMCP's built-in capabilities?
   - Are we following consistent FastMCP design patterns?

This alignment check should be performed at the end of each week to ensure we remain true to our design philosophy.
